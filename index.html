    <h1>The Movie Page</h1>
    <p>Though I am a computer science student, one of my greatest passions has
        been <strong>filmmaking</strong>. I love the art of film but more importantly I love to just watch <em>movies</em>.
        Film is still a very young art form, yet it has spread across the world
        and into nearly <strong>everyone's</strong> homes. People love to go to the movies, talk about what they 
        have recently seen, and most common of all, criticize movies. They have become 
        an <em>inescapable</em> part of our culture. From indie art films to million dollar
        studio blockbusters like <a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/"><em>Iron Man</em></a>. This page will delve into the history of film and 
        its contempory status. </p>
